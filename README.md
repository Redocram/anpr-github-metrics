# anpr-github-metrics
This project uses Js and jQuery library to track the issues on anpr repo.

The queries are exposed on a dashboard designed following the principles written by [Designers Italia](https://designers.italia.it/) especially the colours palette.

### The queries shown in the page are:
- First answer's average time and his distribution over time
- Total issues number

### Tools
- [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) for the queries to Github. For more info, see [GraphQL on GitHub Developer](https://developer.github.com/v4/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for front-end layout
- [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) for schematics
